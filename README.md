# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the selling price of used cars using Machine Learning models.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

## 📊 Models Used

* Linear Regression


## 📈 Model Performance

### Linear Regression

* R² Score: 0.50
* MAE: ₹1.6 lakh

### Random Forest

* R² Score: 0.67 (log scale)

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. Data Cleaning
2. Feature Engineering (Car Age, Brand Extraction)
3. Encoding Categorical Variables
4. Train-Test Split
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation

## 🚀 Conclusion

Random Forest performed better than Linear Regression because car price data is non-linear.
